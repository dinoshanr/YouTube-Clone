# YouTube Learning

## Technologies Used

1. React - Front end JS library
2. Axios - Promise based HTTP client for the browser
3. Material UI - React component for faster and easier web development and you can build your own UI system 
4. JAVA & PostgresSQL - User Services Backend
5. YouTube API - API used to fetch the videos and information

## The Approach

I started my capstone project by brainstorming ideas for a potential full-stack application. I landed on two options which were either building a YouTube clone using google developers API or a Chat Application using ChatKit SDK provided by Pusher. Early on my time at GA, I was always intrigued by Google API due to its flexibility and features so I decided to build an application called YouTube Learning. This application lets users come to search a topic they want to explore and find the best 5 videos on YouTube without being overwhelmed by 100’s of options. I began this project by sketching out how I want the information and the videos to be structured. I broke down technologies I was going to use to build my app. I started building components in the order of how the page is going to be structured top to bottom. I created a search bar, video list, video detail, and video item. After creating the components I imported them to my main app. Knowing that YouTube has a grid system, I used MaterialUI to help me build a YouTube like grid system to fetch my Data. I used Axios for my HTTP requests instead of regular fetch. Learning to use MaterialUI and Axios was great because now I can use these for future projects as well.
